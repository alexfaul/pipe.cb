# pipe.cb
Two-photon + Behavioral Integration - Burgess Lab

pipe.cb has 3 wrappers. The end of a wrapper indicates a break point in the pipe where manual input is required (Cell clicking, pupil detection, etc).

The pipeline is based on inputting entire paths to functions. This avoids common parsing issues and allows easy portability between machines/servers.
findFILE is integral to running pipe.cb

The only changes to run pipe.cb are selecting (indexing) the files to analyze in the wrappers

Thank you to Arthur Sugden for his essential guidance, and Rohan Ramesh for allowing us to use his old code (there's gotta be a better way to say this)
