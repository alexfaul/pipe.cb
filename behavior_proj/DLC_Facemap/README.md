## Script to convert DLC output to Facemap format ##

Save the files to a directory. This is where the files are located that you will need to edit to properly run the script.

* Open "conversionVars.py"
* Add the path to the DLC csv file to the variable "path"
* Make sure to save the changes
* Go to the start menu and open Anaconda Prompt
* Navigate to the directory where the files were saved
* Type the command below

 ```
 
convert_script.py
 
 ```
 
 * The file "hostFile.py" will be changed to contain the data from your csv file
 * Upload "hostFile.py" along with the Facemap file you are comparing in facemap to visualize the difference
