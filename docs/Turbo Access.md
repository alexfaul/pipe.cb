Turbo Setup

1. Download appropriate UM Cisco VPN for your OS and UM role: https://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-
networks/vpn/getting-started
2. Open downloaded .exe file to install (will need admin permissions) and follow prompts.
3. Open Cisco and connect to UM VPN – All Traffic (should be default)
4. Login with uniqname and LEVEL 1 password when prompted.
5. Get to your drives in Windows Explorer (clicking on ‘This PC’ will get you there).
6. In upper left menu bar, Computer-&gt;Map Network Drive
7. Drive is Z: (you can change this to whatever letter speaks to you if you want to shake things up. H, S, &amp; T
drives already exist with your UHMS account)
8. Folder is \\umms-crburge.turbo.storage.umich.edu\umms-crburge
9. CHECK ‘connect using different credentials’ box. If shared computer, UNCHECK ‘reconnect at sign-in’.
10. Enter UMROOT\uniqname and level 1 if prompted (Domain should be UHMS). Click OK and you should be
in.
11. After setup, Turbo will be accessible under your drives whenever you are logged in to Cisco with LEVEL 1.
Notes: You may not be able to use network printers or other local resources while on VPN (even if you try to
have them accessible by changing remote desktop settings—this seems to be UM network authentication issue
rather than RD setting). Disconnect VPN for printing/other access issues you encounter.
